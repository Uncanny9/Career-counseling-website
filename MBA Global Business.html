	  The MBA (Global Business) Program is designed with the objective of preparing managers who are well-conversant not only with the latest managerial concepts, tools, and techniques, but also with the global and regional trends in businesses so that they can take up the challenges of leading and managing their organizations by building a distinct competitive edge in the global and regional context.<br><br>
	  <h3>ELIGIBILITY</h3>
	  Anyone having a bachelor's degree or equivalent with 15 years of formal education (12 years of schooling and three years of graduation) in any discipline with a minimum of 45 percent of the aggregate marks or 2.0 Cumulative Grade Point Average in undergraduate level can apply for admission to MBA (Global Business). Admission to the program is based on the academic promise of applicants as indicated by their academic records, statement of objectives, recommendations, scores on entrance tests, and performance in the personal interview and group discussions.<br><br>
