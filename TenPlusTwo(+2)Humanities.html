	<h2>Ten Plus Two (+2) Humanities</h2>
	<p>
		Plus Two in Humanities is a foundation-level course designed for students who want to pursue their
		undergraduate studies in Mass Communication, Sociology, English, and other related fields of interest. Under
		the National Examination Board (NEB), the Humanities and Social Sciences stream is a two-year plus two-level
		foundation course. It offers a diverse range of subjects such as Language studies, Mass Communication,
		Sociology, Psychology, Economics, Marketing/Business Mathematics, Contemporary Society, and more. By
		exploring these subjects, students gain a holistic approach to education.
		<br><br>
		However, the Humanities and Social Sciences stream has been experiencing a decline in enrollment. Future job
		prospects and personal interests of students may have contributed to the Humanities faculty being the least
		preferred stream among SEE graduates.
		<br><br>
		Prof. Dr. Bidyanath Koirala, an education expert, once said, "Humanities faculty doesn't know how to sell
		itself." To attract present-day students, the course should be designed to reflect the present times while
		preserving its rich history.
		
		<h3>ELIGIBILITY</h3>
		
		Students must have completed SEE or an equivalent examination with a minimum GPA of 1.6. They should have at
		least a D+ grade in English, Nepali, and Social Studies.


		<h3>Tuition Fees for Ten Plus Two (+2) Humanities in Nepal</h3>

		<h3>CURRICULAR STRUCTURE</h3>

		curriculum eliminates the stream-based education system, such as Ten Plus Two Science, Management,
		Humanities, etc.
