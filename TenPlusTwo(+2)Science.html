	<h2>Ten Plus Two (+2) Science</h2>
	<p>
	  Pursuing +2 in Science is suitable for students interested in creating or joining a career in the field of Science and Technology and related disciplines. It provides eligibility for careers in Medicine, Engineering, and other applied and theoretical natural science sectors.
	  <br /><br />
	  <strong>Subject Groups:</strong>
	  <br />
	  1. Computer Group: For students interested in Computer and allied fields.
	  <br />
	  2. Physical Group: For students opting for Engineering and allied fields of Physical Sciences.
	  <br />
	  3. Biological Group: For students interested in medicine and allied fields as well as Bio Sciences.
	  <br /><br />
	  Plus Two in Science offers an integrated package in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Mathematics. The program aims to equip students with a strong foundation for further studies in technology, medicine, engineering, and biotechnology. It is suitable for students with an aptitude for science and mathematics. After completion, students can pursue further studies in medicine, engineering, or other science-related fields.
	  <br /><br />
	  <h3>SALIENT FEATURES</h3>
	  
	  Most students (and their parents) who have achieved good scores in the Secondary Education Examination (SEE) prefer to take up Science in Grade XI.
	  <br /><br />
	  Students who have scored distinction (A+/A) are often encouraged to study Science. Teachers and guardians emphasize that "you should study science as your grades are good enough." They also mention that "Science has better career prospects than Management, Humanities, and Education."
	  <br /><br />
	  +2 in Science is deemed even more important because it opens doors to every discipline. After completing Science in +2, students can pursue higher studies in any discipline, including agriculture, forestry, management, and humanities.
	  
	  <h3>ELIGIBILITY</h3>
	  
	  Students seeking to enroll in Grade 11 Science Subject Group (Physics, Chemistry, Biology/Mathematics/Computer Science/Agriculture) must score the following in SEE:
	  <br />
	  1. GPA: 2.0
	  <br />
	  2. C+ in Science and Math
	  <br />
	  3. D+ in English, Nepali, and Social Studies

	  <h3>JOB PROSPECTS</h3>
	  
	  Although you may not expect immediate job opportunities after passing +2 in Science, you can consider part-time jobs at schools, such as teaching Mathematics/Science or providing home tuition to mentor school-level students. You will also be eligible to sit for the subba level examination of the public service commission (lok sewa aayog).
	  <br /><br />
	  Most students pursue different fields after passing +2 in Science. Some possible study options include:
	  <br /><br />
	  1. Medical: Many students who study Biology in their +2 level aspire to become doctors. They often join preparatory institutions immediately after completing their +2 Science exams. Institutions like KU, TU, BPKIHS, and Patan Academy of Health Sciences provide MBBS programs. Other options include BDS, BPH, B.Sc MLT, BMIT, Bachelor in Pharmacy, Bachelor in Medical Microbiology, etc.
	  <br /><br />
	  2. Engineering: Several universities in Nepal offer various engineering programs, including Bachelor in Civil Engineering, Bachelor in Electronics and Communication, Bachelor in Computer Engineering, Bachelor in Electrical Engineering, Bachelor in Geomatics, Bachelor in Biomedical Engineering, and BE in Information and Technology.
	  <br /><br />
	  3. Computer and IT: Nepal offers various computer and IT-related courses such as BSc. CSIT, BE-IT, BIT, BCA, BE Computer Engineering, and BE in Software Engineering. Students from other disciplines can also enroll in programs like BCA.
	  <br /><br />
	  4. Science and Technology: After +2, students can pursue science and technology courses with specialization in subjects such as Physics, Chemistry, Zoology, Botany, Microbiology, Statistics, etc.
	  <br /><br />
	  5. Management: If you find +2 Science boring and want to switch fields, there are various Management courses available, including BBA, BHM, BTTM, BBA-BI, BBS, etc.
	  <br /><br />
	  <h3>CURRICULAR STRUCTURE</h3>
	  
	  The Curriculum Development Center has recently unveiled a new curriculum for classes 11 and 12, eliminating the system of specific stream-based education like Ten Plus Two Science, Management, Humanities, etc.
