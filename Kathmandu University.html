    <h2>Kathmandu University</h2>
    <p>
        Kathmandu University (KU) is a public autonomous university in Nepal. It is the third oldest university in Nepal, located in Dhulikhel of Kavrepalanchok District, about 30 km (19 mi) east of Kathmandu. It was established in 1991 with the motto "Quality Education for Leadership." KU operates through its seven schools and campuses in Dhulikhel, Patan, Lalitpur, and Panchkhal. The university offers undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate courses in a variety of fields.
        <br><br>
        The precursor to the university, Kathmandu Valley Campus (a private campus under the affiliation of Tribhuvan University), was established in 1985, which provided courses at the Intermediate of Science (ISc) level. The proposal to establish the university was discussed in the Parliament later, and it was approved through an Act on 11 December 1991.
        <br><br>
        When established in November 1991 as a non-profit, autonomous, public university, KU became the first privately managed public institution of higher learning in Nepal. The predecessor of the university was the Kathmandu Valley Campus founded in 1985. The campus started as a private campus affiliated with Tribhuvan University and offered courses in science at the intermediate level (I. SC).
        <br><br>
        Kathmandu University started its academic program in 1992 with an Intermediate in Science program. In 1994, the university launched Bachelor's programs in Pharmacy, Biology, and Engineering (electrical and electronics, computer, and mechanical). Later, Environmental Engineering and Sciences were included in its academic program. M.Phil. and Ph.D. programs were started in 1997. The university also started a Law program under the School of Law in December 2013.
        <br><br>
        Organization and administration:
        <br><br>
        Kathmandu University provides education through seven schools:
        <br><br>
        - School of Arts (KUSOA)
        <br>
        - School of Education (KUSOED)
        <br>
        - School of Engineering (KUSOE)
        <br>
        - School of Law (KUSOL)
        <br>
        - School of Management (KUSOM)
        <br>
        - School of Medical Sciences (KUSMS)
        <br>
        - School of Science (KUSOS)
        <br><br>
        KU has proposed two new schools in Panchkhal Municipality under which Agriculture program and Artificial Program has been started temporarily in Panchkhal, whereas KU-KUNJ is to be made very soon.
        <br><br>
        - School of Agriculture
        <br>
        - School of Forestry
        <br><br>
        The School of Medical Sciences (KUSMS) and the School of Engineering have the highest number of students. The School of Medical Science was formerly known as KUMS, but in 2006 its name was changed to KUSMS, with the view that the school not only trains medical graduates and postgraduates but also runs paramedical disciplines. The School of Science and School of Engineering are present in the university premises, unlike other schools that have affiliated colleges around the nation. The School of Engineering currently runs undergraduate and graduate-level courses mostly in Electrical and Electronics, Mechanical, Computer, Civil, and Geomatics Engineering. It has also recently launched Chemical Engineering and Bachelor of Architecture. The School of Science is currently conducting classes in B.Sc. Human Biology, Environmental Science and Engineering, Biotechnology, and Applied Physics. Chemical Engineering, BSc Nursing in Midwifery, and Bachelor's in Physiotherapy are the recent additions to the list of subjects being offered by KU to students in Nepal for the first time.
