    <h2>MA English</h2>
    <p>
      The Master of Arts in English (MA English) program of Pokhara University was initiated in 2001 and conducted at the
      Institute of Advanced Communication, Education, and Research (IACER), an affiliate institution. The MA in English
      program combines a host of courses that are essential to find cross-disciplinary solutions to contemporary
      problems. Courses in globalization, communication studies, international relations and conflict transformation,
      environmental studies, American studies, and more are offered, all of which are centered on the core English
      Studies program.<br><br>
      The M.A English program consists of four semesters, and students complete the required 60 credit hours in two
      years' time. However, the student is allowed to complete the coursework in four years from the date of
      admission.<br><br>
      If a student is unable to complete the course within the given duration of four years from the time of admission,
      the University registration will be annulled. However, if coursework is completed within four years, an additional
      one year for the thesis can still be extended only for those students who have a genuine cause for extension and
      should be forwarded through the supervisor on behalf of the concerned student to the Programme Coordinator/School
      Director.<br><br>
