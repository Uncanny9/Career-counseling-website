	<h2>GCE A-level Science</h2>
	<p>
		The General Certificate of Education (GCE), run under the Cambridge International Education (CIE) board of Cambridge University, is one of the most recognized qualifications for secondary level education globally. The advanced level General Certificate of Education, commonly referred to as GCE-A Level, is usually studied over a two-year period as Advanced Subsidiary (AS) level and advanced (A or A2) level. A Level is taught in 160 countries with a variety of 70 subjects divided into science and non-science. It is equivalent to the Higher Secondary (10+2) and the two-year Intermediate level studies in Nepal.<br><br>
		The syllabus and examination are set by the University of Cambridge, and the papers are corrected in the UK by approved markers.
