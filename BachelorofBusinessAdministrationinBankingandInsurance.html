	<h2>Bachelor of Business Administration in Banking and Insurance</h2>
	<p>
		The BBA-BI is a four-year, 8-semester bachelor's degree program run by Pokhara University through various affiliated Business Colleges. Currently, 16 Business Schools offer the BBA-BI program in Nepal.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A student needs to successfully complete 126 credit hours of coursework, a summer project, and an internship before graduation. The course is designed to accelerate professional development in students with superior career orientation and versatility.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Over the last two decades, the field of banking, finance, and insurance has become increasingly technical, specialized, and competitive. Innovations in IT have revolutionized this industry, and the entry of global players in this industry has made the market even more competitive. Banking and insurance organizations now require employees who can exhibit skills, knowledge, and experience beyond those provided by typical traditional academic institutes. As a result, there is a significant demand for academic courses that specifically focus on the concepts and skills required for the banking and insurance business. The existing courses in the country do not fully cater to this emerging demand.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The internship lasts for a period of six to eight weeks. Colleges arrange the internship for all the students enrolled in the program. During the internship, a student is supervised by a faculty supervisor assigned from the college and a supervisor from the respective organization where he/she is doing the internship.
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>ELIGIBILITY</h3>
	<p>
		To be eligible for the BBA-BI program, a student must:
