	<h2>Diploma in Computer Engineering</h2>
	<p>
		Diploma in Computer Engineering curriculum is designed to produce middle level skilled technicians updated with the latest skills of computer and information technology, with a view to cope with the emerging technological change. Many people in the developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries have given emphasis to the broader application of computers. Computer Engineering has been contributing to the world's overall development and creating job and employment opportunities in both public and private sectors.<br><br>
		This curriculum is designed to foster knowledge and skills required by computer engineering and information technology-related industries and organizations in Nepal. The Diploma in Computer Engineering program extends over three years, divided into two semesters each year, totaling six semesters in three years.<br><br>
		The first-year courses include basic science subjects like physics, chemistry, and mathematics applicable in the field of computer engineering. It also includes language subjects like Nepali and English applicable for communication in the field of computer engineering and information technology. The second-year courses focus on basic disciplinary subjects of computer engineering. Similarly, the third-year courses comprise disciplinary subjects, the application of learned skills and knowledge through major and minor projects, and elective subjects in specific areas of computer engineering.<br><br>
		The course structure and subject-wise contents described reflect the details of this curriculum. In short, this curriculum guides its implementers to produce competent and highly employable middle-level technical human resources in the field of computer engineering. The contents of each subject prescribed in the curriculum are incorporated based on the "must to know and must to do" principle, with minute descriptions at a micro level.<br><br>

	<h3>JOB PROSPECTS</h3>
	<p>
		After the completion of the Diploma in Computer Engineering course, students will gain knowledge and understanding of computer languages, programming, software, computer hardware, and information technology. With the development of IT in the present world, every department in the government and private sector requires the services of computer programmers and computer engineers.<br><br>
		The graduates will be eligible for the position equivalent to Non-gazetted 1st class (technical) as an Information Technician or as prescribed by the Public Service Commission of Nepal. The graduate will be eligible for registration with the related Council in the grade as provisioned in the related Council Act (if any). There are no specified employment opportunities available in the Computer Engineering trade. It has been found that very few Computer Engineering graduates are wage employed. Some graduates have established computer parts/items selling businesses and are self-employed. Some are engaged in developing software, such as accounting software. A few graduates are employed as trainers as well (CTEVT Tracer Report-2073).
