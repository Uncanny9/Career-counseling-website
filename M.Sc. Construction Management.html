	<h2>M.Sc. Construction Management</h2>
    <p>
      Construction Management is a professional service that uses specialized project management techniques to oversee the planning, design, and construction of a project, from its beginning to its end. The purpose of CM is to control a project's time, cost, and quality. CM is compatible with all project delivery systems, including design-bid-build, design-build, CM At-Risk, and Public Private Partnerships. Professional construction managers may be reserved for lengthy, large-scale, high budget undertakings (commercial real estate, transportation infrastructure, industrial facilities, and military infrastructure), called capital projects.
    </p>

    <h3>ELIGIBILITY</h3>
    <p>
      To be eligible for admission to the Master Program, candidates must hold a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree in Civil or Agriculture, or an equivalent degree recognized by the Institute of Engineering (IOE). Additionally, candidates should have undergraduate grades that are significantly above average and meet the minimum requirements set by the faculty board of IOE. They must also attain a minimum score in the entrance test conducted by the IOE Entrance Board or as recommended by a special entrance committee for foreign students. Equivalence refers to a degree obtained from institutions other than Tribhuvan University (TU) but recognized by TU as equivalent in the same discipline.
