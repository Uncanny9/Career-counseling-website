	<h2>Ten Plus Two (+2) Law</h2>
	<p>
		The Ten Plus Two (+2) program in Law is a two-year program offered by the National Examination Board (NEB). If
		someone is seeking to start a career in the administrative/legal sector, a degree in Law provides the perfect
		platform to embark on the right path. Law is one of the most exciting and popular courses for both domestic
		and international students. It serves as an instrument to transform a static society into a dynamic one and
		enables the voice of the people to access justice in society.
		<br><br>
		Law is an attractive and popular subject in any country due to its fantastic career prospects, and Nepal is no
		exception. The history of the judicial system in Nepal has evolved through various phases, from uncodified to
		codified laws, from a kingdom to a republic, and from customary to legislative. Nepal's new criminal and civil
		codes of 2075 are a testament to these changes.
